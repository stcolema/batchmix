#' @title Run MCMC Chains
#' @description Run multiple chains of the batch mixture model of the same type.
#' @param X Data to cluster as a matrix with the items to cluster held in rows.
#' @param n_chains Integer. Number of MCMC chains to run.
#' @param batch_vec Labels identifying which batch each item being clustered is
#' from.
#' @param R The number of iterations in the sampler.
#' @param thin The factor by which the samples generated are thinned, e.g. if
#' ``thin=50`` only every 50th sample is kept.
#' @param type Character indicating density type to use. One of 'MVN'
#' (multivariate normal distribution) or 'MVT' (multivariate t distribution).
#' ``weights`` which is a matrix with K x B columns. The columns are ordered by
#' batch, i.e. the first K columns contain the class weights in the first batch,
#' the second K are the class weights in the second batch, etc. If generic
#' weights are used then this matrix has K columns, one for each component weight.
#' @param K_max The number of components to include (the upper bound on the
#' number of clusters in each sample). Defaults to the number of unique labels
#' in ``initial_labels``.
#' @param initial_labels Initial clustering, if none given defaults to a random draw.
#' @param fixed Which items are fixed in their initial label. If not given,
#' defaults to a vector of 0 meaning the model is run unsupervised.
#' @param alpha The concentration parameter for the stick-breaking prior and the
#' weights in the model.
#' @param mu_proposal_window The proposal window for the cluster mean proposal
#' kernel. The proposal density is a Gaussian distribution, the window is the
#' variance.
#' @param cov_proposal_window The proposal window for the cluster covariance
#' proposal kernel. The proposal density is a Wishart distribution, this
#' argument is the reciprocal of the degree of freedom.
#' @param m_proposal_window The proposal window for the batch mean proposal
#'  kernel. The proposal density is a Gaussian distribution, the window is the
#' variance.
#' @param S_proposal_window The proposal window for the batch standard deviation
#'  proposal kernel. The proposal density is a Gamma distribution, this
#' argument is the reciprocal of the rate.
#' @param t_df_proposal_window The proposal window for the degrees of freedom
#' for the multivariate t distribution (not used if type is not 'MVT'). The
#' proposal density is a Gamma distribution, this argument is the reciprocal of
#' the rate.
#' @param m_scale The scale hyperparameter for the batch shift prior
#' distribution. This defines the scale of the batch effect upon the mean and
#' should be in (0, 1]. If `NULL`, this quantity is sampled rather then fixed.
#' @param rho The shape of the prior distribution for the batch scale.
#' @param theta The scale of the prior distribution for the batch scale.
#' @param initial_class_means A $P x K$ matrix of initial values for the class
#' means. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.
#' @param initial_class_covariance A $P x P x K$ array of initial values for
#' the class covariance matrices. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.
#' @param initial_batch_shift A $P x B$ matrix of initial values for the batch
#' shift effect Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.
#' @param initial_batch_scale A $P x B$ matrix of initial values for the batch
#' scales Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.
#' @param initial_class_df A $K$ vector of initial values for the class degrees
#' of freedom. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.
#' @param verbose Logiccal indicating if warning about proposal windows should
#' be printed.
#' @returns A list of named lists. Each entry is the output of
#' ``runBatchMix``.
