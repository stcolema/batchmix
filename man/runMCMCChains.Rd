\arguments{
\item{X}{Data to cluster as a matrix with the items to cluster held in rows.}

\item{n_chains}{Integer. Number of MCMC chains to run.}

\item{R}{The number of iterations in the sampler.}

\item{thin}{The factor by which the samples generated are thinned, e.g. if
``thin=50`` only every 50th sample is kept.}

\item{batch_vec}{Labels identifying which batch each item being clustered is
from.}

\item{type}{Character indicating density type to use. One of 'MVN'
(multivariate normal distribution) or 'MVT' (multivariate t distribution).
``weights`` which is a matrix with K x B columns. The columns are ordered by
batch, i.e. the first K columns contain the class weights in the first batch,
the second K are the class weights in the second batch, etc. If generic
weights are used then this matrix has K columns, one for each component weight.}

\item{K_max}{The number of components to include (the upper bound on the
number of clusters in each sample). Defaults to the number of unique labels
in ``initial_labels``.}

\item{initial_labels}{Initial clustering, if none given defaults to a random draw.}

\item{fixed}{Which items are fixed in their initial label. If not given,
defaults to a vector of 0 meaning the model is run unsupervised.}

\item{alpha}{The concentration parameter for the stick-breaking prior and the
weights in the model.}

\item{mu_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the cluster mean proposal
kernel. The proposal density is a Gaussian distribution, the window is the
variance.}

\item{cov_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the cluster covariance
proposal kernel. The proposal density is a Wishart distribution, this
argument is the reciprocal of the degree of freedom.}

\item{m_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the batch mean proposal
 kernel. The proposal density is a Gaussian distribution, the window is the
variance.}

\item{S_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the batch standard deviation
 proposal kernel. The proposal density is a Gamma distribution, this
argument is the reciprocal of the rate.}

\item{t_df_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the degrees of freedom
for the multivariate t distribution (not used if type is not 'MVT'). The
proposal density is a Gamma distribution, this argument is the reciprocal of
the rate.}

\item{m_scale}{The scale hyperparameter for the batch shift prior
distribution. This defines the scale of the batch effect upon the mean and
should be in (0, 1].}

\item{rho}{The shape of the prior distribution for the batch scale.}

\item{theta}{The scale of the prior distribution for the batch scale.}

\item{initial_class_means}{A $P x K$ matrix of initial values for the class
means. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_class_covariance}{A $P x P x K$ array of initial values for
the class covariance matrices. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_batch_shift}{A $P x B$ matrix of initial values for the batch
shift effect Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_batch_scale}{A $P x B$ matrix of initial values for the batch
scales Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_class_df}{A $K$ vector of initial values for the class degrees
of freedom. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{verbose}{Logiccal indicating if warning about proposal windows should
be printed.}
