\title{Bayesian Mixture Modelling for Joint Model-Based 
Clustering/Classification and Batch Correction}
\description{
Semi-supervised and unsupervised Bayesian mixture models that 
simultaneously infer the cluster/class structure and a batch correction. 
Densities available are the multivariate normal and the multivariate t. 
The model sampler is implemented in C++. This package is aimed at analysis of 
low-dimensional data generated across several batches. See 
(Coleman et al. (2022))[https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.14.476352] for 
details of the model.

\examples{

# Data in a matrix format
X <- matrix(c(rnorm(100, 0, 1), rnorm(100, 3, 1)), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# Initial labelling
labels <- c(rep(1, 10), 
  sample(c(1,2), size = 40, replace = TRUE), 
  rep(2, 10), 
  sample(c(1,2), size = 40, replace = TRUE)
)

# Which labels are observed
fixed <- c(rep(1, 10), rep(0, 40), rep(1, 10), rep(0, 40))

# Batch
batch_vec <- sample(seq(1, 5), replace = TRUE, size = 100)

# Sampling parameters
R <- 1000
thin <- 50

# Classification
samples <- batchSemiSupervisedMixtureModel(X, 
  R, 
  thin, 
  labels, 
  fixed, 
  batch_vec, 
  "MVN"
)

# Clustering
samples <- batchUnsupervisedMixtureModel(X, R, thin, batch_vec, "MVT")
