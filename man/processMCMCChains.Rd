processMCMCChains(mcmc_lst, burn)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc_lst}{Output from ``runMCMCChains``}

\item{burn}{The number of MCMC samples to drop as part of a burn in.}
}
\value{
A named list similar to the output of 
``batchSemiSupervisedMixtureModel`` with some additional entries:

 * ``mean_est``:  $(P x K)$ matrix. The point estimate of the cluster 
 means with columns  corresponding to clusters.
 
 * ``cov_est``:  $(P x P x K)$ array. The point estimate of the 
 cluster covariance matrices with slices corresponding to clusters.
 
 * ``shift_est``:  $(P x B)$ matrix. The point estimate of the batch 
 shift effect with columns  corresponding to batches.
 
 * ``scale_est``:  $(P x B)$ matrix. The point estimate of the batch
 scale effects. The $bth$ column contains the diagonal entries of the scaling 
 matrix for the $bth£ batch.
 
 * ``mean_sum_est``:  $(P x K x B)$ array. The point estimate of the
 sum of the cluster  means and the batch shift effect with columns 
 corresponding to clusters and slices to batches.
 
 * ``cov_comb_est``:  List of length $B$, with each entry being a 
 $(P x P x K)$ array. The point estimate of the combination of the 
 cluster covariance matrices and the batch scale effect with list entries
 corresponding to batches and slices of each array corresponding to clusters.
 
 * ``inferred_dataset``:  $(N x P)$ matrix. The inferred ``batch-free''
 dataset.
 
 * ``allocation_probability``:  $(N x K)$ matrix. The point estimate of 
 the allocation probabilities for each data point to each class.
 
 * ``prob``:  $N$ vector. The point estimate of the probability of being 
 allocated to the class with the highest probability.
 
 * ``pred``:  $N$ vector. The predicted class for each sample.

\description{
Applies a burn in to and finds a point estimate for each of the 
chains outputted from ``runMCMCChains``.
